Scuttle is a responsive web-based audio archival tool for managing and playing your personal audio collection.

- Search and download audio
- Play, pause, and skip tracks
- Create and manage playlists
- Self-host your audio library and stream to any device with a browser
- Imports playlists from external services (e.g. Spotify) to mirror or organize your personal collection

This requires Python 3.8+ to install. Setting up will install binaries for ffmpeg and cloudflared. You can run Scuttle by downloading this as a zip, and running ```scuttle.bat``` on Windows (No support for one-click setup on Linux or Mac yet). For manual setup see [installation](#installation) and [usage](#usage) for more details. No support for automatic updates yet.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository
Navigate to a folder where you want to put Scuttle, open a terminal and run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/whimsypingu/scuttle.git
```

Then run this to preview options:
```bash
cd scuttle
```

```bash
python main.py --help
```

For Windows, the ```scuttle.bat``` file can be double-clicked to perform all setup.
No one-click installer for Linux or Mac yet.


### 2. Setup the environment
Run the setup script to prepare the python environment. This will:
* Create a Python virtual environment (```/venv```)
* Install all required python library dependencies (please see ```/requirements.txt``` in [dependencies](#dependencies))
* Download a ```cloudflared``` executable for tunneling from [the official open source repository](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/latest/)
* Install ffmpeg into the virtual python environment if necessary (Only for Windows right now)

```bash
python main.py --setup
```

### 3. Activate the virtual environment
Before running the server, activate the virtual environment:

| Platform             | Command                     |
| -------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Windows (cmd)        | `venv\Scripts\activate`     |
| Windows (PowerShell) | `venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1` |
| macOS/Linux          | `source venv/bin/activate`  |


## Usage

### 1. Start the server
Ensure you've [activated the virtual environment](#3-activate-the-virtual-environment) first. 

Run:
```bash
python main.py
```


#### 1.1 (Optional) Set up Discord webhook notifications:
Scuttle can provide the tunneled link to a Discord channel using a webhook URL, so you can access your audio on any device that has access to the channel. To set this up:

1. Follow [this official guide](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks) to get a Discord webhook URL (~2 min)
2. Run the following command to save the webhook URL to your `.env` file:
```bash
python main.py --set-webhook [URL]
```

ðŸ’¡ While the server is running, your device will stay awake to maintain the connection, though the display may turn off to conserve battery. Note that closing a laptop may turn off the server (at least, it did for me once).


### 2. Shut down the server
Press ```Ctrl+C``` in the terminal to shut off the server and allow your device to sleep normally again.


## Architecture
Scuttle was built to provide users with a free and simple audio streaming service. At a really basic level it consists of a client-server model:

- **Backend (Python)**
    - Runs a local HTTP server using FastAPI
    - Handles audio download, library management, and tunneling (via Cloudflared).
- **Frontend (JavaScript)**
    - Responsive web UI served by the backend
    - Handles playback, queue management, playlists, etc
    - Communicates with server through REST and Websocket endpoints

    A -->|"Cloudflared (get a url)"| B
    B --> C
    C -->|"REST"| A
    A -->|"Websocket"| C
```


## Dependencies
This project requires Python 3.8+ and the following Python packages:

- **yt-dlp** â€“ Download and manage audio/video content.  
- **FastAPI** â€“ Web framework for building the backend API.  
- **uvicorn[standard]** â€“ ASGI server to run the FastAPI app.  
- **websockets** â€“ Real-time communication support.  
- **pydantic** â€“ Data validation and parsing.  
- **python-dotenv** â€“ Load environment variables from `.env` files.  
- **requests** â€“ Make HTTP requests to external APIs.

These are installed during [setup of the virtual environment](#2-setup-the-environment). You can install all dependencies manually with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Known Issues
There are some known bugs that haven't been bothered to be fixed yet.
* Cleaning out unused downloads (Done, but only on restart)
* yt-dlp updating in case of failure
* yt-dlp download options and timeout failure cleanup/notification on frontend.
* Clearing DNS cache (Occasionally breaks cloudflared. If tunnel can't be resolved, clear the cache in command line and retry)
* Potential breakage of floating point indexing of database after many re-orders - just re-normalize indices per playlist every now and then. Have to find an optimal time to do this though, and the willpower to write the code.


## Future Features
Scuttle is still in active development. Here are some planned features and improvements grouped by category:

**User Experience:**
- [ ] Tracking user audio actions and usage, to provide a recap by month or even suggest artists or creators to donate to or support based on percentage listened
- [ ] Mobile UI improvements (swipe on queue to play next)
- [x] Auto queue songs in a playlist on download
- [ ] Improved search functionality
- [ ] Pagination for faster loading with larger libraries
- [x] Optimized rendering for faster UI performance
- [ ] Audio volume normalization across tracks

**Integrations:**
- [ ] Import playlist from YouTube, other sources
- [ ] User authentication and multi-user support
- [ ] Syncing to a central server (?) for recommendations
- [ ] Virtual network option (Tailscale?)
- [ ] Recommendations (Last.fm?)

**Tools:**
- [ ] Audio editing (silence removal, enhanced quality)
- [ ] Backend management from the web interface (download queue, server restart)

These are not guaranteed but they reflect the current development priorities and ideas for future releases.
